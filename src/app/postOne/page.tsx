    return  <><h1>Taking a Breath... How relaxing and stepping away helped me problem solve.</h1><p className="post1"> This week for my discussion post I listened to the Syntax podcast that went over different ways to problem solve. They were able to provide great tips and solutions that really came into play for me this week. There have been lots of changes happening around me that have been making me struggle a bit more than normal. I was able to get through by assessing what I knew, finding where my problems were coming from and then looking for a solution through my various resources. I had never deployed a project before with GitHub pages nor had I used Next.js to create an app let alone Jekyll for a static site. These were a little intimidating for me in the beginning until I really let myself try, even if I failed. There were a lot of failed attempts but slowly after doing more research and really honing in was I able to succeed. Letting myself have those moments to step away and take a breath helped clear my head thus making it easier for me to implement the changes needed. </p></>;
