I knew of the basics such as discounts for streaming services and music apps but not much for school or learning resources. In this class, I was reminded that there are various student opportunities just waiting to be discovered. I recently applied and got the GitHub education package. Although this was introduced to us in the beginning, I didnâ€™t give it too much thought as most of my classmates were struggling with the verification process. But once I got it I realized how foolish I was to have waited. There are so many resources I could have used throughout my journey. Seeing as I know I'm not the only person to be late to the game, I have decided to dive a bit deeper and see what other perks there are. I know now that I need to take advantage of these perks because I will not be a student for long. I want to gather all the perks I find and make a bigger post for other students like myself who might not know more resources are out there.   </p>
