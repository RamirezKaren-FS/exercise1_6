I had never given much thought to the possibility of someone being able to have custom packages until they were shown to me by other professors. I thought this concept was way out of reach and only something generally available to more “professional coders” and not a beginning student. When I was shown the NPM site I found out its actually a much simpler process than I could have imagined. I just had to create my free account and log into it on my terminal to begin posing my own packages. These came in handy when we needed to create our own testing scripts for our projects. I believe they will also come in handy later on when I’m working on different projects as I can tailor my packages to hold everything needed for that specific project.  </p><Footer></Footer></>;
